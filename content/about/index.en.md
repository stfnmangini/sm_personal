# Hi, I'm Stefano :(fab fa-angellist):
I am PhD student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Pavia (Italy) under the supervision of Prof. Chiara Macchiavello, in the **Qu**antum **I**nformation **T**heory   ([QUIT](https://www.qubit.it/)) group.

My PhD research project is focused on **Quantum Computing**, and in particular to one of its most prominent application, **Quantum Machine Learning**.
Broadly speaking, I'm very interested in topics which lies in the intersection between Quantum Computing and Theoretical Computer Science.

## Short Bio  
I was born in Puglia, a wonderful region (go check it out) in the southern part of Italy. After High School, I moved to Trieste to study Physics in the University of Triste, where I obtained my Bachelor degree in *Physics*, and my Master degree in *Theoretical Physics*, both with full marks. Right after (i.e. now), I moved to Pavia (near Milan) where Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD on *Quantum Computing*.   

## Career

## Other  
Apart for academic stuff, I am a slow travel lover and mountain enthusiast. I love hiking and rock climbing, reading books and playing guitar, cook (vegan ðŸŒ±) and discuss environmental and social sustainability.

In case you asked, that's me with a weird smile in front of a glacier in Iceland.
