# Hi, I'm Stefano :(fab fa-angellist):
I am researcher on Quantum Computing at [Algorithmiq](https://algorithmiq.fi/), and a PostDoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki. 

Previosuly I was a Ph.D. student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Pavia (Italy) under the supervision of Prof. Chiara Macchiavello, in the **Qu**antum **I**nformation **T**heory ([QUIT](https://www.qubit.it/)) group. My research during the Ph.D. focused on *Quantum Computing*, and in particular on *Quantum Machine Learning* and *Variational Quantum Algorithms*.

Broadly speaking, I'm very interested in topics which lies in the intersection between Quantum Computing and Computer Science. For more details, visit the _Research_ page!

## Short (academic) bio  
I was born in Puglia, a wonderful region (go check it out) in the southern part of Italy. After High School, I moved to Trieste (norhtern Italy) to study Physics in the University of Triste, where I obtained my Bachelor degree in *Physics*, and my Master degree in *Theoretical Physics*, both with full marks. 

Then I moved to Pavia (near Milan) to pursue a Ph.D. on *Quantum Computing*, which finished at the start of 2023 (actually, I'm still waiting to defend the thesis). 

At the moment I live in Helsinki, where I contiue researching on quantum computing at Algorithmiq and at the University of Helsinki.

## Teaching 
Here is a list of courses I've been involved to: [Classes](/teaching/)

## Other  
Moving to more serious stuff, apart for work/academy, I am a slow travel lover ü•æ and mountain enthusiast ‚õ∞Ô∏è. I love hiking, rock climbing, reading, playing guitar, and cooking (vegan üå±), and I'm very interested in environmental and social sustainability (full on Universal Basic Income!).

Also, together with some friend we created [BeQuantum](https://www.bequantum.it/), the italian community on quantum technolgies, go check it out! 

In case you asked, that's me ‚Äìkind of 5 years ago as of 2023‚Äì with a weird smile in front of a glacier in Iceland.
