My research is focused on Quantum Computation and Information, and I'm interested also in topics from Theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. 

As much as I like to put my hand to theory, I also always look for a computational approach to problems. 
> In Feynman's words: *«What I cannot create* [that is, code], *I do not understand»*.

At the moment, for my PhD I am investigating and studying one of the most interesting application of Quantum Computing, that is Quantum Machine Learning.

**Programming languages and tools**: Qiskit, Pennylane, Python, Fortran, Mathematica, ...
