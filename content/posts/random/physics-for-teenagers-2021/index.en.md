# From the Turing Machine to the Quantum Computer (with a hint of AI)
This is the presentation of the talk I gave at a Physics stage for High Schoolers at the University of Pavia. Given the audience, the presentation is in Italian and it deals with the story of computation, from the Turing Machine to Quantum Computers, with a digression on Artificial Intelligence.    
The recording is available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ciWk282bsB4).
