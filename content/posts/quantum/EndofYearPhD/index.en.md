# What is Quantum Machine Learning?

Yesterday I took part in the End of Year seminars of PhD students at University of Pavia. For the end of my first year, I had to I talk about my research field, Quantum Machine Learning, introducing the state of the art, drawbacks and future possibilities.  
Here is my presentation, go check it out: [_presentation_](/documents/QML_Mangini_EndOfYear.pdf).
