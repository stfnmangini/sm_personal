# Variational Learning for quantum artificial neural networks

Here is the presentation for the contributing talk I gave at the *Summer School: Machine Learning for Quantum Physics and Chemistry* organized by the wonderful team at University of Warsaw!

The talk is based on this work: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9364892
