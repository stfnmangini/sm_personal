My PhD research project is focused on Quantum Computing, and in particular to one of its most prominent application, Quantum Machine Learning. Broadly speaking, I’m very interested in topics which lies in the intersection between Quantum Computing and Theoretical Computer Science. For more details, visit the Research page!

After High School, I moved to Trieste to study Physics in the University of Triste, where I obtained my Bachelor degree in Physics, and my Master degree in Theoretical Physics, both with full marks. Right after (i.e. now), I moved to Pavia (near Milan) where I’m pursuing my PhD on Quantum Computing.
