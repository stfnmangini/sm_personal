Yesterday I took part in the End of Year seminars of PhD students at University of Pavia. For the end of my first year, I had to I talk about my research field, Quantum Machine Learning, introducing the state of the art, drawbacks and future possibilities.

Unfortunately, the article was targeted to an Italian audience and it is then written in Italian, because you can already find great resources and information on the topic in english. For example, here are some resources dealing with different aspects of livestock and dairy farming: Greenpeace vision: Less is More. Reducing meat and dairy for a healthier life and planet, by Greenpeace. Research article: Reducing food‚Äôs environmental impacts through producers and consumers There is also a great resource (in english) by Greepeace analyzing the theme in great detail: Less is more. Definitely worth reading! Climate Change: Our World in Data: Meat and Dairy Production (strongly recommend to have a look on all the pages on the website, which is great.) Animal cruelty: Earthling Ed Human health: NutritionFacts, Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets If you‚Äôre interested, you may want to check the bibliography in the article, which contains 70+ citations to relevant papers on the subject. Here are some curiosities treated in the article: üå± A properly planned plant based diet, apart from being nutritionally adequate, offers protection against many common diseases of our epoch, like cancer and cardiovascular diseases. üåç One third on Earth surface (one third!) is devoted exclusively to livestock and dairy farming; üêÑ More than 70 billions animals (that‚Äôs ten times the human population) are killed each year for food; üè≠ Livestock farming is the second greatest carbon emitter industry; üçî Water needed to produce a single beef hamburger, is equal to that consume in two month of showers; We need to act now to stop Climate change!

My PhD research project is focused on Quantum Computing, and in particular to one of its most prominent application, Quantum Machine Learning. Broadly speaking, I‚Äôm very interested in topics which lies in the intersection between Quantum Computing and Theoretical Computer Science. For more details, visit the Research page!

After High School, I moved to Trieste to study Physics in the University of Triste, where I obtained my Bachelor degree in Physics, and my Master degree in Theoretical Physics, both with full marks. Right after (i.e. now), I moved to Pavia (near Milan) where I‚Äôm pursuing my PhD on Quantum Computing.

I‚Äôm half a Theoretician and Programmer (I love spending time on my computer), using both approaches when dealing with a problem. At the moment, for my PhD I am investigating and studying one of the most interesting application of Quantum Computing, that is Quantum Machine Learning.
