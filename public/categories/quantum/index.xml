Yesterday I took part in the End of Year seminars of PhD students at University of Pavia. For the end of my first year, I had to I talk about my research field, Quantum Machine Learning, introducing the state of the art, drawbacks and future possibilities.
Here is my presentation, go check it out: presentation.
