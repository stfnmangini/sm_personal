My research is focused on Quantum Computation and Information, and I'm interested also in topics coming from Theoretical Computer Science. Iâ€™m half a Theoretician and Programmer (I love spending time on my computer), using both approaches when dealing with a problem.

At the moment, for my PhD I am investigating and studying one of the most interesting application of Quantum Computing, that is Quantum Machine Learning.

**Programming languages and tools**: Qiskit, Pennylane, Python, Fortran, Mathematica, ...
