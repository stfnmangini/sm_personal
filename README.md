# Personal Website

This repo contains the code for my personal website at https://stefanomangini.com

The files are hosted here on GitHub but the website is hosted and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), 
which offers more freedom wrt to github pages (and that's still free! :D)  

Don't remember exactly how I did it :sweat_smile:, but there are plenty of resources and tutorial online on how to use Netlify 
to deploy a website form a GitHub repository.  

In this way, changing the website is incredibly easy, just:    
1. Modify the files on your local machine,  
2. commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository,  
3. Netlify will automatically detect the changes and build and publish the modified website in a matter of seconds.  

Ain't that great?

### Details

The website is based on the amazing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) [LoveIt theme](https://hugoloveit.com/).

The particle effect on the landing page uses [*particle.js*](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/), a lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles.
